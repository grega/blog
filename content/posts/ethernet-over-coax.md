MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance) allows coaxial cables to be used instead of Ethernet cables. This is particularly useful when there are coaxial cables already installed, such as feeding from a roof antenna down into a house, and it would be desirable to use these cables for networking purposes instead of running new Ethernet cables between rooms.
